- **Duration:** 1 minute
---

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: **bat**, **cat**, **crab**, **frog** (toad), **hawk**, **lizard**, **octopus**, **owl**, **poisonous snake**, fish (**quipper**), **rat**, **raven**, **sea horse**, **spider**, or **weasel**. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.

Additional animal form choices may be available at the DM's discretion.

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

When the familiar drops to {"0"} hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.

While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

{name} creates the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

{name} can use their action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, they can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful *Intelligence* (Investigation) check, DC {ssDC}. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.
Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.

This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful *Intelligence* (Investigation) check, DC {ssDC}, to be discerned.

That creature must succeed on a *Dexterity* saving throw, DC {ssDC}, or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down {"3 feet"} above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.

A restrained creature can make a *Dexterity* saving throw, DC {ssDC}, at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an *Intelligence* (Arcana) check, DC {ssDC}. On a success, the restrained effect ends.

For example, the disk can't move across a *10-foot-deep* pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.
